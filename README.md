Practical example app requirements:

- use create react app

- upload to a git repo with commits as needed

- query the following API to get data

- https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/movies/search/?page=pageNumber

- display data in tabular grid

- implement pagination, include first, last, prev, next buttons, also show current page number

- include a filter box to filter the results on matching data as you type

- implement column clicks to affect sort order asc/desc

- use triangle indicator in column header to signal applied sort

- clicking on a row should highlight row, ditto hover over row should highlight row also

- create an abstraction for fetching data from API using a custom hook

- style as you please if you have time



- bonus task:

- implement functionality to select multiple rows and include button “add to my favourites”

- no API call to external storage necessary, just implement in local storage
